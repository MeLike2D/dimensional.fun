So this is totally my first every blog post. I've never really been one to write, if you knew my grade in English class you would already know that so don't expect many blog posts from me.

I'll probably just write posts about how cool I am and how I suck at life but at-least im trying! My next post might be on my [discord bot](https://mixtape.systems) or something lol, mainly how im migrating from a monolithic architecture to a microservice architecture using rabbitmq and several different languages like **Kotlin**, **Go**, and **Rust**.

Also i'm pretty sure the only reason I made this blog is for the experience, and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) looked really nice (that's what im currently using).
